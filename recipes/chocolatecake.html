    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a moist two-layer round chocolate cake. It is perfect with a chocolate frosting or fruit filling, and can be easily adapted as a vegan recipe.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon espresso powder</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable or canola oil</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare two 9-inch cake pans by spraying with baking spray or buttering and lightly flouring.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, salt and espresso powder in a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk through to combine or, using your paddle attachment, stir through flour mixture until combined well.</li>
        <li>Add milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla to flour mixture and mix together on medium speed until well combined. Reduce speed and carefully add boiling water to the cake batter. Beat on high speed for about 1 minute to add air to the batter.</li>
        <li>Distribute cake batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until a toothpick or cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and allow to cool for about 10 minutes, remove from the pan and cool completely.</li>
        <li>Frost cake with Chocolate Buttercream Frosting.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>The cake batter will be very thin after adding the boiling water. This is correct!</p>
