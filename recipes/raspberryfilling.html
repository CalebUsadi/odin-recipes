        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Simple raspberry filling for use with chocolate cake or any other recipe.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 packages (6 ounces each) fresh raspberries</li>
            <li>0.75 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>Pinch of coarse salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>While cakes are baking, stir together 3 cups raspberries, sugar, salt, and lemon juice in a medium saucepan. Cook over high, stirring frequently and mashing with the back of a spoon, until mixture comes to a boil, 2 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring, until mixture thickens and clings to spoon, 7 to 8 minutes more. (You should have 1 1/3 cups.)</li>
            <li>Let cool 30 minutes. Stir in 2 cups raspberries, reserving remainder.</li>
            <li>Spread half of filling over one cake. Top with second layer; spread remaining filling over top. Top with final layer, cut-side down. Refrigerate, covered, at least 1 hour and up to overnight. Spread frosting over top and sides of cake. Garnish with remaining raspberries.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>This recipe often makes more filling than is needed, it can be refrigerated or frozen for later. Used with <a href="./chocolatecake.html">chocolate cake</a>.</p>
